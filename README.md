## Back Home - A Turing Mod 3 FEE Project

### Synopsis
This project contains a card-based interface displaying architectural and interior design images across twelve fundamental design styles and six design categories.  These images are scraped from the [Houzz website](houzz.com/photos) using the [Cheerio module](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio).  The project provides functionality to select and display the user's favorite images, as well as a calculation of the user's style preferences.


### Set Up

Clone the repo

Run `npm install` from the root directory

Run `npm start` and visit localhost:3000 in your browser
